A silly little errorhandler for Love2d to save you the 20 minutes of making it :)

All you need to do to use this library is add << require"lovely_errors/lovely_errors" >>
to your main.lua or wherever u want and make sure the lovely_errors folder with everything
in it is in the same folder as wherever you require it from

To change the image, replace the image with your new one and name it 'animegurl.jgp',
or alternatively edit the first line of lovely_errors.lua

The same goes for the font lmao ˚₊‧꒰ა ☆ ໒꒱ ‧₊˚
