A cute little errorhandler for Love2d to save you the 20 minutes of making it :)

All you need to use this library is: require"lovely_errors"

To change the image, replace the image with your new one and name it 'animegurl.jgp',
or alternatively edit the first line of lovely_errors.lua

The same goes for the font lmao ˚₊‧꒰ა ☆ ໒꒱ ‧₊˚
